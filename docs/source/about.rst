About
=============



Spin Scenario is a new open source simulation package, which offers the MR practitioner a unified scripting environment in a “plug-and-play” format, that provides a new, flexible and intuitive pulse sequence programming syntax for rapid sequence prototyping.

* **General, fast MR simulations**   
    It uses accelerated Liouville space computing model being compatible with MR imaging and MR spectroscopy.

* **Flexible scenario scripting**    
    The powerful Lua bindings offer users a flexible, intuitive and unique scripting environment for the creation of MR scenarios.

* **Elegant pulse sequence programming**   
    The specially designed programming syntax enables a clear, concise, and accurate description of pulse sequences.  

* **Efficient pulse optimization**   
    The build-in optimal control module provides an easy way for optimization of shaped pulses as well as cooperative pulses.
